# Install

```
npm i -g @mountainpass/hooked-cli
```

# Why

I want to be able to setup advanced build server scripts, that can be run:
- by anyone
- with no project knowledge
- anywhere (locally or remotely)
- anytime

When executing the scripts, it must be:
- consistent
- intuitive
- forgiving
- suggestive
- simple

I want something simpler and more easy to use...

‚úÖ pros of hooked ‚úÖ
- **less context switching** - one file for all scripts (or multiple, choose your own adventure!).
- **more readable** - because of "smart" completion, script names can be more verbose (symbols!).
- **less environment configuration** - only required environment variables are resolved, meaning non-admins don't need a full environment setup.
- **more extensible** - supports more generic, reusable, parameterised scripts.
- **less typing** - using `j _logs_`, users can rebuild/redeploy (almost) handsfree.
- **scripts reuse** - scripts that call other scripts = easy pipelines.
- **scripts for documentation** - scripts can print out information, or be used to open websites e.g. `open https://somewebsite.com`

# Usage

```sh
j --help
```
(the 'j' is a fishing hook!)

---

## Getting started

Just type `--init`, and it'll ask to choose a sample `hooked.yaml` config file to start with.
```sh
j --init
```

## Preconfigured environments

Use `--env` to specify the global environment/s you'd like to use. 
```sh
j --env <yourenv1,yourenv2,etc>
```

## Rerunnable commands

Here is some example output:
```sh
Using environment: default
? What is your name? Bob
? Please select a script say
? Please select a script hello
Found script: say hello
rerun: j say hello -e default -in '{"FIRSTNAME":"Bob"}'
Hello world, Bob (nickpersonal)!
git commit is -> (279e8b9)
```

Note the `rerun: ...` output? You can use that, to rerun a command, with all inputs predefined:
```sh
j say hello --env default --stdin '{"FIRSTNAME":"Bob"}'
```

## Copy other people

Similar to the `rerun` output, you can see (and copy) what others have run recently:
```
j --log
```

## Suggested scripts

Don't worry, if you can't remember the full script path, you'll be prompted. Try this:
```sh
j
```

## Smart complete scripts

Feeling ~~lazy~~ efficient? Try typing some prefix characters of the script or environment. As long as it's enough to uniquely identify your script, the tool will do the rest!

*Example: shorthand for run "say hello --env spanish*
```sh
j s hel --env sp
```

Don't forget to commit `hooked.yaml` and `.hooked_history.log` files to source control, for the next person!
